# Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Integration with .Stat Suite

## 1. What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs).

> Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices to various peripherals, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to diverse data sources and tools.

## 2. How Does MCP Work?

MCP is inspired by the **Language Server Protocol (LSP)** and enables secure, structured communication between models, tools, and data sources.

### Core Components

- **MCP Host**  
- **MCP Client**  
- **MCP Server**

These components enable a typical workflow where:
1. A user sends a prompt to the MCP client.
2. The client analyzes the intent and queries the MCP server.
3. External APIs/tools are invoked.
4. The system retrieves and processes data, then responds back to the user.

### Communication Layer

- The MCP client initiates communication by querying the server’s capabilities.
- The server replies with a list of available tools and resources.
- A continuous exchange of notifications keeps the client updated with server status and changes.

### Security Considerations

- The protocol must mitigate configuration drift.
- Developers are encouraged to use **infrastructure-as-code (IaC)** and **automated configuration management**.

## 4. Possibilities for Integration with .Stat Suite

While MCP and .Stat Suite originate from different domains (AI interaction vs statistical data systems), integration is possible via APIs.

### 1. Accessing .Stat Suite Data via MCP Tools

- Define a tool specification for .Stat's **SDMX REST API**.
- Query statistical indicators via MCP-compatible tools.
- Output structured JSON for model input.

**Example Query**:  
“What was the unemployment rate in France in 2022?”

### 2. Automatic Query Generation

LLMs can:

- Understand natural language questions.
- Convert to SDMX RESTful queries.
- Return processed results in conversational formats.

### 3. Conversational Interface for Statistics

By combining:

- MCP for intelligent dialogue,
- .Stat Suite as a data backend,
- And a web/desktop UI,

...you can create a smart assistant for statistical exploration and analysis.

## 5. Technical Requirements for Integration

- Access to `.Stat Suite` API endpoints (e.g., `/rest/data/`)
- MCP tool definition in JSON
- Middleware to convert SDMX responses to readable JSON
- Optional: Persistent memory for storing user preferences and past queries

---

## 6. Conclusion

**Model Context Protocol** offers a powerful foundation for building intelligent, context-aware AI agents. Integration with **.Stat Suite** allows:

- Conversational access to public data
- Natural language data exploration
- Personalized statistical reporting

This can support data journalists, researchers, policymakers, and citizens seeking transparent and intelligent access to statistics.
